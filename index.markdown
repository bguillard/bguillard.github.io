# Hello!

I am Benoît, a 4th year PhD student at **[EPFL’s CvLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/)**, supervised by **[Prof. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en)**.

My work is focused on finding good representations for 3D surface reconstruction and manipulation with neural networks. I was lucky to do research internships at Microsoft Research in 2021 and Meta (Reality Labs) in 2022.
